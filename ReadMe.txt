AS2CBENCH stands for Accelerated Synthesizable SystemC Benchmark suite.
It is a accelerated version of S2CBENCH .S2CBENCH stands for Synthesizable SystemC 
Benchmark suite.It is a open sourceSystemC benchmarks created to help designers evaluate 
the QoR of state of the art HLS Tools. 

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the AS2Cbenchs have also be created to allow its easier use. The package comes with a .rbf (raw bianry file) which when copied to the SD card automatically configures the FPGA when booting it with ten of the AS2Cbench benchmarks.
